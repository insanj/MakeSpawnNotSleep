MakeSpawnNotSleep - Make Spawns, Not Sleep!
Version: v1.1

After installing MakeSpawnNotSleep, no users will be able to sleep, instead, whenever anyone clicks a bed, his spawn will be set to his current location.

Features:
Makes spawns set instead of sleeping.
Removes the "you can only sleep at night" message.
Still allows for beds to break!
